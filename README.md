Hello and welcome to project documentation 1. I have to introduce myself, I am Esa Khan, a 13 yr old, who makes random gadgets. I made this to stop my brother from stealing my stuff from my drawer.
Parts for this project are linked here. These are amazon links, if you need help, contact me via email.
1. Servo Motor - https://amzn.eu/d/68anxTq
2. Freenove I2C LCD Display - https://amzn.eu/d/0cPOW5S
3. Metal Servo Arm - https://amzn.eu/d/10ZSQb5
4. Key Lock - https://amzn.eu/d/8qjopkJ
5. Servo Hook, I used a piece of wood for the servo arm to hook on, not allowing it to open, I would recommend find something useless made of wood and use a piece of it.
6. PCA9865 - Stops Servo Jitter, best investment (in my opinion) -
Ok, so lets start by installing the modules for this project. Go ahead and start up a fresh linux OS on your Raspberry Pi (intended for use on RPi). Linux debian is suggested WITH Desktop.
